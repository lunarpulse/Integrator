Integrator

Development of the Ultrasonic collision avoidance for UAVs.

This repository is soley for making the data integrator, which processes data fusion betwenn 15 sensors of 2 types.
This will have two branches:
	1. Onboard Autonomous : for on board computers for autonomy
	2. Assitance to Uban : for human operators to add collision avoidance to their control

Originally from a private repository on my git server:
git@git.lunarpulse.org:UAVs/UCA/Integrator.git
